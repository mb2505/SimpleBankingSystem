# SimpleBankingSystem
Everything goes digital these days, and so does money. Today, most people have credit cards, which save us time, energy and nerves. 
From not having to carry a wallet full of cash to consumer protection, cards make our lives easier in many ways. 
In this project, i developed a simple banking system with a sql database.

This program simulates a banking system which generates creditcards using the "Luhn Algorithm" and stores them in a SQLite Database.
It is possible to add income to your card and also transfer money to other creditcard acounts. The path to the database is passed with
input parameters ("-fileName card.s3db").
